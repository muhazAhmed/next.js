#useEffect

What is useEffect Nextjs?
CSR - Client-Side Rendering is a common data fetching method using useEffect. It will fetch the data from the API every single page request on the client-side (after the page is rendered, then the function will run).

Here we are using this for setTimout, which will help us to go back to the given page after the given certain time(3000(3s)) automatically without pressing any button or refreshing the page. 
We have used that in 404.js file.
