As a part of the previous tutorial, we saw Image Component. We created the applications with a very minimal change in its content. Open the same folder where you created the index file.


If you could carefully observe the default template of the application and visit the index.js page, you would find an import named Head from next/head. If that import were assumed to be removed, you would get an error to see. And this is because the default template of the application uses the Head component and features an executable program in it.

Head>
        title>Next.JS</title
        meta name="description" content="Generated by create next app" /
        link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
/Head>
 

The Head component contains the title tag which for our website has Hunting Coder written in it and this gets reflected on the browserâ€™s title bar.  We could have used JavaScript instead of Next if we had been using React, but Next gives us the convenience of injecting elements directly into the Head. Using this, you can add a custom title, CSS and any meta tags within the head component of your web page as per your requirements. 

 

Some meta tags popularly used are,

Description - This meta tag is used to define the description of the webpage.
Keywords - This meta tag is used to define keywords for search engines.
